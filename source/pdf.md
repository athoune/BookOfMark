#PDF

PDF is the standard for publishing document for reading or printing.

## FOP

[FOP](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/) is the ultimate to build PDF from XML. I'm not an ultimate warrior, I died three times trying to use this tool.
The fourth time, I tried LaTeX. It should be easy to build *.fo* files from raw HTML files.

## LaTeX

[LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) is a venerable format to build nice documentation.
The module [hyperref](http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html) add all the PDF wonders.

## InDesign

Indesign can import data from XML file.
